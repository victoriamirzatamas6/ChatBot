# ChatBot
Langchain PDF Chatbot - mistral model-

This chatbot is designed to operate within a specific domain, focusing on providing expert assistance related to a given PDF documentation. It is built using the LangChain framework, leveraging models like LLaMA and Mistral for its language understanding and generation capabilities. The chatbot is initialized with a comprehensive chain of components, including callback handlers for asynchronous operations, a prompt template that sets the conversation context, and a vector store for retrieving relevant information from a document database.

The system's architecture supports streaming responses, enabling real-time interaction with users. It can maintain a conversation history, allowing it to provide contextually relevant responses by recalling previous exchanges. This memory mechanism is crucial for the chatbot to follow the conversation's flow and ensure coherence in its replies.

For the backend, a FastAPI application is set up to handle HTTP requests, facilitating easy integration with web services. This setup includes an asynchronous worker that processes incoming queries, placing them in an inference queue. The chatbot dynamically generates responses based on the user's input and the conversation history, streaming the output back to the client. The application is designed to be robust and scalable, capable of handling multiple simultaneous requests through its asynchronous processing model.
